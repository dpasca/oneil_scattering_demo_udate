This is an unofficial update of the original atmospheric scattering demo from Sean O'Neil, related to the article in *GPU Gems* 2.

The intent is to revive this demo and do the following:
- Compile under Visual Studio 2015
- Improve clarity by removing unused code and using modern C++ where useful
- Change OpenGL API calls and shaders to modern standards
- Extrapolate the atmospheric scattering functionalities to reuse them outside this demo

The first commit of this distirbution starts off the original distribution, for historical purposes.
